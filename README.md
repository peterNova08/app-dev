# 🕷️ **Spider-Man**  

Spider-Man is my favorite movie! It's about a young guy, **Peter Parker**, who gets superpowers after being bitten by a radioactive spider. He learns to use his powers to help people.  

## 🎥 Versions I Like  
- **Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man**: The first movies that started it all.  
- **Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man**: A cool and emotional version.  
- **Tom Holland's Spider-Man**: Fun and part of the Avengers!  

## 🦸 Why It's Awesome  
- The action scenes are so cool, especially when he swings between buildings.  
- Peter is a regular guy with problems, like school and friends, but still becomes a hero.  
- The line:  
  > *“With great power comes great responsibility.”*  

Spider-Man is an amazing movie, and I think everyone should watch it! 🕸️
